see like i really don't know what happened with this project 
i just found this randomly as one of my sublime text tabs and i was about to delete it 
but like why not just put in on the website so i get to draw more stick figures in adobe photoshop 
and i didn't wanna waste this alert like if im gonna be honest this is just an excuse to have this alert on my website 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<style type="text/css">
		#circle{
			width: 100px;
			height: 100px;
			background-color: blueviolet;
			border-radius: 50%;
			position: absolute;

		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<div id ="circle"></div>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		alert("it's been a long time since I came up with an alert I now have had two kids and I live in a little island right off the coast of Madagascar with the penguins from, you guessed it, Madagascar. Rico is the best one in my opinion but don't tell Skipper that or he'll take another one of my kids I only have Johnny left to myself this is a secret cry for help guys")

		circle.style.left = Math.random()*200+ "px"
		function changeColor(){
		var a = Math.round(Math.random()*255)

		var b = Math.round(Math.random()*255)

		var c = Math.round(Math.random()*255)

		circle.style.backgroundColor="rgb("+a +","+b+","+c+ ")";
	}
		
		setInterval(changeColor, 200)


		function changePosition(){
		var x = parseInt(circle.style.left) 
		circle.style.left = x + + Math.random()*10+"px"}
		
		setInterval(changePosition, 200)
