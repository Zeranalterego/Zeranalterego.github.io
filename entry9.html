	<p>Cutting the image of Sam W's face up and making it all fit together in divs was by far the most time consuming part of this project. There's not much else to say. Most of the javascript user interaction was done in a lab with Molly, and I learned a lot of new stuff, so that was fun. Idk, this project was funny, a bit time consuming a bit less fun than the Trumpet Bounce vibing cat with all the changing colors, but still worth it. I still have to show this to him, so his reaction will make it even more worth it. And if his reaction doesn't make it more worth it, don't expect to see him in school tomorrow. </p>
