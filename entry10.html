<body>
	<p> Style for car div is made. Width is set height is set background color is set position is set. Then car div is actually made in body. Then javascript, where car horizontal position is set to 0. Then variable x is created and turned into a integer data type. Variable x is set to the car's current horizontal location. Then an event listener is made so whenever a key is pressed, 10 is added to x, and the car's horizontal location is set to x so the car moves 10 pixels left every time a key is pressed.
