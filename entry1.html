		alert ("In the song 'papercuts' by Machine Gun Kelly, which can be found in his 2021 album 'Mainstream Sellout', one of the lyrics is, 'I'm a genius, could've made Donda', which is an ironic reference to just how bad and basic this album is that this lyric actually made me laugh out loud because no, Machine Gun Kelly. No, you couldn't have made Donda. You really couldn't have. Comparing yourself to Kanye is like Liz Truss comparing her term in office to the expiration date of honey. It is also a great prefaced comparison to how the song directly after 'papercuts' ,'WW4', ends with MGK saying 'Okay, this was gonna be a song on the album but I can't sing anything right now so this is the song', something I actually happen to really agree with. ALSO, in the song 'WW4', there's this lyric that says,'They want to monitor us. Let's go and find the mainframe and blow the monitor up', which, like, is such a genius line and MGK was right he is a genius and there is nothing wrong with this lyric nothing logically wrong at all no no it's definitely one of the lyrics of all time I really hope you can read the sarcasm here because THIS LYRIC IS SO BAD THE ENTIRE ALBUM IS SO BAD OH MY GODDDDDDDDDD THE PRODUCTION IS BAD THE MIXING IS BAD THE ONLY GOOD THING IS THAT THE DRUMS KINDA SOUND NICE BUT MGK'S SINGING ACTUALLY WARRANTS A VISIT TO THE OTOLARYNGOLOGIST")

	 <p>September 21, 2022 <br> It was pretty cool this first week of Comp-Sci to start thinking about the internet, the GUI, and just the world of tech in general in a much different way than I had thought of it all my life up to this point. The ability to grasp the concept of the internet and what actually goes on in a computer is muych more in depth than I previously thought. Pretty excited for the year.</p>
