	<p>If you asked me how this idea came to mind, I would not have an answer for you. If you asked me how I coded this, it would actually be pretty simple if you excluded correctly pairing up the correct amount of parentheses and brackets. It's just a song playing after a div crosses a position and the code for the user to be able to control the div moving with four different keys. Oh, and then a div appearing and syncing that up to the song. It's not revolutionary code, but if you can find another person who has done something like this before I will give you my life savings. I am at worried for my mental well being and my satanic leanings but also maniacally laughing at how maniacally weird I find myself maniacally. So there you go. I admit it, Richard. I have an ego. Richard isn't a real person I know idk its just the first name that came to mind I really don't know how to end this journal entry</p>
