<p> September 21, 2022 <br> It was pretty cool this first week of Comp-Sci to start thinking about the internet, the GUI, and just the world of tech in general in a much different way than I had thought of it all my life up to this point. The ability to grasp the concept of the internet and what actually goes on in a computer is muych more in depth than I previously thought.

<p> October 1, 2022 <br> Today, I watched three pretty simple videos on the basics of the web, the html language, and how to modify text a bit using html. The line break after October 1, 2022, was taught to me by one of those videos, actually. It's quite interesting and frankly, pretty cool, to quote my last journal entry, to be learning things that could be reflected directly into tangible, visible changes in a website of my creation. Computers have always been a bit unfamiliar to me, at least the inner workings and languages that direct webpages, applications, and such, so being introduced to these topics and being able to create something of the sorts myself is pretty nifty. I was told that I was going to spend countless hours working on my website it my own time, and I didn't really believe it at first, but a few weeks in, I'm starting to get maybe why I was told that.

<p>October 7, 2022 <br> See, none of my code is actually working. I mean, the style section. But I'm putting down all the code nevertheless because it's probably just a simple missed indent or something like that that's screwing up the entire thing. I'm gonna book a lab with Molly and hopefully get it all fixed soon. It's definitely quite a lot of code. I have an animation with 20 keyframe sections. Yeah, I definitely get the obsessiveness that can come quite easily with coding projects like this. It would be so fun to like, be good at coding. Like, proficient at it. Idk, something like 10 lines per minute, and have them all work flawlessly most of the time. That would be so fun. I don't even know why I wrote this journal entry I'm in lab and I'm bored ig.
