So I can then capture them and harvest their organs while they\'re alive! And then I can sell their organs to the next trading caravan that comes across for tons of money!" That was the day I fundamentally changed as a human.')

	 <p>October 7, 2022 <br> See, none of my code is actually working. I mean, the style section. But I'm putting down all the code nevertheless because it's probably just a simple missed indent or something like that that's screwing up the entire thing. I'm gonna book a lab with Molly and hopefully get it all fixed soon. It's definitely quite a lot of code. I have an animation with 20 keyframes. Yeah, I definitely get the obsessiveness that can come quite easily with coding projects like this. It would be so fun to like, be good at coding. Like, proficient at it. Idk, something like 10 lines per minute, and have them all work flawlessly most of the time. That would be so fun. I don't even know why I wrote this journal entry I'm in lab and I'm bored ig. </p>
