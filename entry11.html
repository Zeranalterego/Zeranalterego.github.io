	<p> Uhhhh so this is like a valentines idrk it's like weird but also really funny imo but mostly because of the message and the inside jokes I have with the person this Valentines is for and yeah. Cutting the picture apart was really hard and making it all fit together pefectly with absolute postitions while each part of the picture was on a different div is a newly discovered phobia but in the end I think it was worth it? I dont really know but it did make me learn a lot about code so that's a plus. This was the most interactive project I've ever done so that was pretty cool</p>
