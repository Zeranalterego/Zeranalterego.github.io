	<p>May 24, 2023<br>It's been fun! Farewell, and may you be immortal! Literally, of course. I hope you lose your mind due to the inevitable marching of time! It is the end of freshman year and I feel like my skull contains no brain anymore but it's all okay because all of this is to get into college, an institution who prioritizes the rich and money and legacy admissions over providing education to the parts of the population who need it most so then the class divide widens so if you really think about it the colleges we glamourize as these prestigious centers of education really just cement the class divide into our society further because businesses and companies look for college diplomas to filter potential employees so in order to function in capitalist society in the most basic terms one has to first be rich! but we don't care because we are heartless and also in expensive private schools so we are so disconnected from like actual actual reality not just in America but in literally every other country less developed than us with lower QOL/score on the Human Development Index and oh my god that leads to so much bad stuff but it's okay its all worth it in the end because the Ivy League is the end goal but not compassion or morality or empathy or kindness no no no its that sweet sweet diploma from Harvard LETS FUCKING GO THE MYTH OF SOCIAL MOBILITY IN CAPITALIST AMERICA see like. I'm still a teenager with a lot to learn so I don't know everything. I'm sure I have some key misconceptions of the system and of society, and there's a lot of things that I'm not considering, sure. But like. You don't have to go to college in order to see that something is deeply deeply wrong with this but YALE LETS FUCKING GO somebody help but don't help me I'm insanely lucky to be privileged as fuck somebody help the world</p>
