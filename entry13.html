	<p>May 24, 2023<br>It's been fun! Farewell, and may you be immortal! Literally, of course. I hope you lose your mind due to the inevitable marching of time! It is the end of freshman year and I feel like my skull contains no brain anymore but it's all okay because all of this is to get into college, college college college college college! I don't know what I'm saying man I guess in terms of reflecting on this class idk it was fun if you utilize this class well you can get a lot done and creating your own website is actually a really cool way to  express your creativity goodbye </p>
