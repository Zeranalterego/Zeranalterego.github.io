	 <p> October 1, 2022 <br> Today, I watched three pretty simple videos on the basics of the web, the html language, and how to modify text a bit using html. The line break after October 1, 2022, was taught to me by one of those videos, actually. It's quite interesting and frankly, pretty cool, to quote my last journal entry, to be learning things that could be reflected directly into tangible, visible changes in a website of my creation. Computers have always been a bit unfamiliar to me, at least the inner workings and languages that direct webpages, applications, and such, so being introduced to these topics and being able to create something of the sorts myself is pretty nifty. I was told that I was going to spend countless hours working on my website it my own time, and I didn't really believe it at first, but a few weeks in, I'm starting to get maybe why I was told that.
