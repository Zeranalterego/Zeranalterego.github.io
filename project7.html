		var artists = ["Ariana Grande: 7 rings and thank u, next are overrated, but her music is still good. Very poppy and a bit formulaic and times but the execution is super good so who cares. Insane vocals, production is perfection on some of her songs and the lyrics on some of her popular songs do make a lot of sense and hit harder because of the context of her life, so overall, W artist", "NF: If you like this guy you probably need some form of therapy ahahaha I'm in the top 0.001 % of his listeners on Spotifyyyyy but his music is SO GOOD", "The Chainsmokers: Guilty pleasure. NPC type beats but like it's catchy and if you forget it's the Chainsmokers and ignore the shaky production at times and the GOD AWFUL VOCAL EFFECTS, some of the ideas of their songs are good, like Something Just Like This, You Owe Me, Somebody, and Young. Look, they're not the worst. They're like a mindless vibe, but Young has been one of my favorite songs for a long time, although that may just be due to nostalgic reasons", "Coldplay: I don't know their music well but I tried to listen to A Rush of Blood to the Head and that was the most boring album ever. Or maybe I just didn't get the idea behind it, but A Hymn for a Weekend is strangely enjoyable, so idk", "Dream: Not gonna lie...all of his songs have horrible production, like, the bass is so BAD and the mixing is terrible, and the vocal delivery is mediocre although respectable from a YouTuber (Wilbur Soot supremacy still), but...the writing of the songs are not that bad. Like, ok, Roadtrip is just horrible. But the writing for Mask, WHILE, it may be a bit stereotypical and cringey, I can see how some people may genuinely relate to that song and listen to it because of reasons past just being a Dream fan. Also, Change My Clothes is a decent song. It's very Alec Benjamin-esque, but whatever. Alec Benjamin has some bangers", "6ix9ine: Isn't he like a criminal? I don't know but just by the name itself and the pictures I have seen I want to distance myself from this person and his music as much as possible", "Khalid: Such a unique voice, and his voice fits a vibe that surprisingly isn't too confined. Some of his songs are genuinely really enjoyable, and although his collaborations with electronic music artists like Marshmello or Disclosure have their faults and are supremely less enjoyable than songs like Young Dumb and Broke or lovely, they're still listenable. ", "Billie Eilish: WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO was my favorite album by a lot for a while. However, you get tired of listening to Billie's sound really quick, and don't smile at me has some great songs too, but WWAFA, WDWG is just a better execution of the same vibe, albeit a bit darker. However, having said that, Billie's sound is really really enjoyable, and carries a vibe unlike no other. Her new album, Happier Than Ever, is in my opinion, way harder to get bored of, and Happier Than Ever, is such a good song. It's really a new milestone for Billie in her music, the production has reached new levels, and it seems like she's branching out and experimenting with a lot of new sounds now, which makes me really excited for her future projetcs", "Kid Rock: I don't know if you know this, but on his new album, named Bad Reputation, there's a parental advisory warning tag on the album cover, but instead of saying Parental Advisory, Explicit Content, it says Snowflake Advisory, Explicit Content, and I think that is all I have to really say for this artist, because oh my god this is the most far-right core I have ever heard. This album has everything. It has an anti-vaxxer anthem, it has racist lyrics, it has a bunch of lines about fake news and freedom and oh my god it's so bad. The lyrics and messages are the some of the most problematic I have ever encountered. Unlistenable", "Beyoncé: queen? I don't know anything about Beyoncé lmao I came to America in 6th grade and the first impression of Beyoncé I got was that one SNL sketch where basically the premise was you would get erased from this world and hunted down by special police called the  'Beygency' if not every song of Beyoncé's was your favorite song so I got scared and now all I have is positive opinions about her so, so like, I guess she's like elevated to some sort of divine status? I don't know I don't listen to any of her music" , "The Weekend: Pop done right. And music done right. He is so gooooooooooood like After Hours is filled with so many good ideas and maybe instrumentally he lacks some stuff but I haven't ran through his entire discography and I don't know everything. However, the songs I have listened to are near perfection in terms of production and just like overall music quality. He's one of the rare artists where like every single one of his super popular songs are enjoyable to me too. The Hills especially is one of my favorites. The bass hits different on that song, man. I only call you when it's HAAAAAALFFF PASTTTT FIVEEEEE", "Flyysoulja and Kodiyakredd: lmfao. If you listen to them you're just horny and like looking at the music video. Their song Im An Island Boy is the seventh level of production vocal musical hell", "Eminem: Is he the greatest MC of all time? I don't know. But you cannot deny, there is nobody else on the world right now or in history that is capable of making the songs Rap God, Lose Yourself, and Stan. He may have fell off a bit, but his flows are still there, his skill at pure rap is still there, the wordplay is still there, and yeah. He's definitely one of the greatest MC's of all time. Also Mockingbird is such an underrated song", "Harry Styles: wATeRmeLOn sUgAR hIgHHhHhhHhHhhHhHHhhhHhHhHhHHHhhhhh overrated as hell the only reason he's popular is because he used to be part of One Direction and his songs have bright production", "Selena Gomez: i'm so RAREEEEEIJWIRWRWJLWEWRW idk her music is boring", "G-Eazy: Hey, all I'm saying is that I find it ironic that G-Eazy and Halsey made a song about how much they loved each other, how they were all that they had in the world and how they loved each other to death...and then like broke up half a year later", "Kid Cudi: Mr. Rager is my favorite song of all time and Kid Cudi is an absolute banger of an artist when talking about his hits...but sometimes the rest of discography falls flat. Mr. Rager Pursuit of Happiness, Day'N'Nite, love., Erase Me - Main, Scott Mescudi Vs. The World, and Soundtrack 2 My Life are some of my favorite songs ever, but...when running through his discography, I was often disappointed. Bit of a hit or miss, but the production is always good, and the hits are some of the best hits out there", "Gorillaz: their music is a refined taste for sure, but Feel Good Inc is a timeless classic and their other songs carry a vibe I can't really place but the weird but high quality production does a good job at making their other songs decently enjoyable ", "Michael Jackson: I'm asking Annie r u ok while moonwalking like a smooth criminal and that's all I have to say. AEOWWWW", "Imagine Dragons: Look. They are a good band. They have good songs in every album. It's Time hits hard, Radioactive is so nostalgic, Evolve is less enjoyable but it's alright, and ORIGIN DOES NOT DESERVE THE HATE IT GETS. NATURAL IS A GOOD SONG, ALTHOUGH A BIT BLAND. MACHINE HAS SO MUCH ENERGY! BAD LIAR IS THE SAME THING AS NATURAL BUT A BIT BETTER. ZERO IS A CERTIFIED BANGER AND I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK IT'S SUC AN AMAZING SONG. BULLET IN A GUN IS ALSO AMAZING YOU ALL ARE JUST TASTELESS. And Birds is good as well. Also, Mercury - Acts 1 & 2 have some of Imagine Dragon's best music like you guys just hate for invalid reasons. Cutthroat is an insane song that cannot be rivaled, and songs like Lonely, Wrecked, Monday, Giants, Dull Knives, One Day, Blur, Higher Ground, Waves, and Ferris Wheel feel like Imagine Dragons is finally coming into their element and creating a much more mature, enjoyable sound. Also I hope Dan Reynolds is doing well. Wrecked really hits hard", "My Chemical Romance: Emo music done right. The writing on their album Welcome to the Black Parade is unparalleled writing. The execution is unparalled execution. There is not a single disappointing song on that album. Easily my favorite band of all time and artist right now. If I could call anything tortured energy, I would call that album that. The instrumental is just so ethereal, but also so hellishly powerful. You genuinely have to try them. Try Welcome to the Black Parade first though. Their other albums are quite meh, although Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge has some bangers like Helena and I'm Not Okay(I Promise). I haven't ran through Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, but I don't think it can beat WTHBP. Truly an unreal band. I had my doubts when trying them out at first, but all of them have since been wiped away. It's such good music", "Mac Miller: I don't know much about his music, nor have I listened to much of it, but his death was a really tragic event, and Love Lost is one of my favorite songs right now. His laid back and subtle beats with almost lo-fi elements really complement how he raps and the sort of message/vibe he goes for. I have really liked the music I've tried from him so far, although, sometimes, I will say, a few of his songs lack that one little thing that makes it spark and truly enjoyable for me", "Lil Peep: People will hate on him, but all of them are wrong. Only enjoyers of Lil Peep's music will truly understand what I'm talking about, but just know, if you don't like him, you are objectively wrong. His songs make you feel like you're drowning, but, like, in a good way. It is dark, autotuned heaven, and any of you who do not think so are heathens who will die devoid of true fulfillment", "XXXTENTACION: good.", "Marshmello: There was a time where Marshmello used to make mega pop hits using very formulaic, stereotypical song formatting, loud, catchy production, and famous vocals. He's still doing that actually, kinda. I used to like that sound, until I realized the songs were just really hard to stand and listen to more than once a year. However, there is one exception. Happier is a genuinely good song and the music video will forever tear at my heart", "Alan Walker: He's always been a vibe. Yes, Alan Walker does have a very distince signature sound that is quite repetetive, but somehow, it doesn't get too boring. Maybe this is for nostalgic reasons, but his drops and instrumentals always carry out this futuristic sort of dreamy electronic vibe while still differentiating itself from more modern and experimental electronic music, which I find to be quite enjoyable. He is also maturing his sound like everybody is doing at the moment, but some of his older songs, especially on his Different World album and the old classics like Faded and Ignite, are still are extremely catchy and enjoyable", "OneRepublic: I AINT WORRIED BOUT IT RIGHT NOWWWWWW KEEPIN DREAMS ALIVEEE NINETEEN NINETY NINE HEROES is overrated as hell and the whistling could have delivered so much more than it does, but hey, one song doesn't define the band. Secrets is a good song, I used to listen to Apologize religiously. I don't know, they're alright I guess", "Justin Bieber: babyyyyy babyyy babyyyyy OHHHHHHHHH I'm so loneeeeeeeeeeelyyyyyyyyyyyy This kid is a joke lmao you get your weed from California? I get my weed from the MOON I'm on that next level also like isn't Lonely the song embodiment of DJ Khaled suffering from success but done in a really pretentious self-egotistial and pitying way that just like kinda makes for one of the worst songs of 2020?", "Troye Sivan: So many underrated bangers. Blue Neighborhood is one of the first albums I enjoyed from front to end, and the songs from it are still extremely enjoyable now. He has this chill, undertone pop vibe that still finds a way to deliver energy at the correct places and the right ways. Instrumentally, Troye Sivan still provides adequate variation, and in recent years he's been becoming more experimental, which I appreciate but at the same time nothing can beat for him., SUBURBIA, BLUE, LOST BOY, HEAVEN, TOO GOOD and TALK ME DOWN for me. All those songs are from Blue Neighborhood, and it's definitely an album you should try out", "Charlie Puth: SEEEEEE YOUUUUU AGAINNNNNNN AHHHH AH AHHHH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I used to like him until I realized how insufferable his music was but See You Again is a really really good song. Oh, and some of his songs on Nine Track Mind are ok. Dangerously was a song I genuinely enjoyed, although now, returning to it, the vocal delivery doesn't come off as I think Charlie wanted it to, and One Call Away is overrated but still decent", "Why Don't We: I don't really know if this counts as a guilty pleasure or not, but I genuinely really like a lot of their music. Or at least I used to like a lot of their music until I literally listened to it too much for it to be enjoyable. Sure, the sounds are basic, and yes, I agree, some of their popular songs are truly stereotypical to no end and bland both lyrically and musically...but...The Good Times and The Bad Ones is filled with decent and vibey tracks. Grey is a beautiful song, and there's a good blend of energy and sensitivity in it. In the end, they're better than BTS has been in recent years, so...that has to count for something? Maybe?", "Taylor Swift: I don't listen to her music but it has to be good because if I say anything else the swifties will kill me as will some of my friends who listen to her like religiously. I will say that her albums are really impressive, like the times when they drop are so heavily anticipated, and the fact that she had 10 of her songs on the top 10 of the Billboard Top 100 and all of them were from her new album Midnights says something", "Joji: THE LEGACY OF FILTHY FRANK AND PINK GUY LIVES ON. I will admit Joji's sound is very repetitive and he has a very obvious vocal and instrumental circle he's comfortable in, but I don't really get tired of his sound because it's SO DAMN GOOD ", "Olivia Rodrigo: I genuinely don't know her songs are catchy the ideas and passion are palpable so like good artist?", "Kanye West: Shit person but did a lot for hip hop...idk he really just needs to shut up and like get help. Like ever since the slavery comments and red pill taking it's gotten so much worse the Hitler praise is truly shitty to the point of no return if there even was a point of return for Kanye before and their is absolutely no justification for this guy...but musically, removing everything he is as a person, some of his old music is catchy as hell. After all, who was in Paris?", "AJR: Catchy trash. I am not proud of my AJR phase", "Panic! At the Disco: Their new album is laughable and their only good song is High Hopes, although High Hopes is also overrated as hell. ME! is carried by Taylor and I'm sorry their music is just really bland. There's an attempt at making something different and meaningful, definitely, in their music, but it just doesn't do it for me. Also like it isn't even a band anymore it's just Brandon Urie making trash like Viva Las Vengeance","Drake: most overrated rapper and worst album cover creator in history, but hey, he lives off of controversy and gets money from it so idk maybe he's smarter than all of us", "David Guetta: he ended racism guys (if you don't get this I don't know whether to be happy or sad for you)", "Flo Rida: I had a moment of epiphany when I realized that Flo Rida was a wordplay on how he was born in Florida, but Flo Rida also means flow rider, and he raps, and flows, rapping, he rides on the flows, oh my god, I was so excited and mind-blown when I figured this out just like one day randomly when revisiting some of his songs. I don't know, the name is pretty sick, and I guess his music gets the people moving, which is what his music tries to do, so I don't mind him", "Childish Gambino: insane. Also search up This Is America and Call Me Maybe mix on Youtube. It's actually so funny. He is just such a talented person and you can see it in the way he executes the production and ideas of his music", "Vance Joy: I'm sorry I don't get the appeal of Riptide. You all are delusional for liking it as much as you do", "Post Malone: honestly just a living tattoo making absolute bangers"]
