Like I just squeezed out the last drops of motivation I had in myself for today to start my homework and the first thing I do is a journal entry I wasn't even assigned as homework.

	<p> November 8, 2022 <br> Today, we dived a bit deeper into javascript, and we actually created a function ourselves that allowed a picture on the screen to follow our mouse as we dragged it across the page, which was really cool. I guess the thing that I remember most in today's class was when Molly asked us to try to center the image on the mouse instead of having our mouse be at the top left corner of the image, and I figured it out pretty quickly on my own, which was nice. Other than that, it's just cool to learn about different types of coding languages and what they each do. Javascript so far is definitely the hardest one to learn, but it is also definitely the most fun one to use when you code your website, because the amount of interactive things you could do with it are just endless. And me, being a insufferable troll, am super excited because I see a lot of really dumb and stupid things I could do with javascript. But you know this already. You've probably encountered at least two or more of my shenanigans on you're way to this journal entry. </p>
