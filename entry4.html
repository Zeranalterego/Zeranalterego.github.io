See, you thought for half a second after reading the first clause that I was going to give you an interesting fact, like all of the world's potatoes can stack up to the moon or something like that, but you forgot that one of the things I am quite proficient in doing is subverting expectations. I have just wasted another 5 seconds of your time. L ratio")

	<p>October 25, 2022 <br> The animation referenced in the last journal entry that was 20 keyframes is now 25 keyframes. Honestly, the hardest part of making the animation has been figuring out the Sublime text pixel limit before the div moves out of the page and the user has to scroll. Google has given me no answer and it has just been a long journey of trial and error, saving and reloading. Now it kinda works though. Only like, 4 of the frames go out of the page now? Whenever you change something in code and you save it, and proceed to see the intended changes on the actual website, it always comes with this cool feeling of learning and succeeding at something new. Kinda cool. So far, I've learned...that somewhere in between 700 and 900 is the pixel limit you have to use before the div goes out of the page. Oh, and I've gone crazy with the Javascript alert system. You'll see lmao. Actually, you've probably already seen by now if you've visited like literally anything else in my website. This CS1 class should've came with "addiction with small, particular parts of code" as one of their potential side effects</p>
